Kees van Deemter is an Emeritus Professor at the University of Utrecht, where he has been a major support and proponent of research in computational linguistics since 2018.
As a long-standing expert in the area of Natural Language Generation, he focuses on structured inputs and their limits: his work ranges from logic-to-text systems to vagueness in natural language, and from referring expressions to some of the caveats of modern neural NLP systems.
