Kees van Deemter is an Emeritus Professor at the University of Utrecht, where he has been a major support and proponent of research in computational linguistics since 2018.
As a long-standing expert in the area of Natural Language Generation, he focuses on structured inputs and their limits: his work ranges from logic-to-text systems to vagueness in natural language, and from referring expressions to some of the caveats of modern neural NLP systems.
Luckily for me, he has recently written an autoworkography tracing back his steps, so I can point you to his own words that will do a much better job at retracing his steps than I can: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04142}.
