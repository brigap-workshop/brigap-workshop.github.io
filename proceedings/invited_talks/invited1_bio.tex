Anna Rogers is an tenured Associate Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen is one of the foremost experts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Her expertise ranges from ethics in NLP to frame semantics, and from computational social science to interpretability.
Her experience has not only been recognized through 6000+ citations, but also through significant duties within the scientific community, including heading the scientific committee of the ACL, the premier conference in NLP, in 2023, and more recently taking on the role of co-editor-in-chief for the ACL Rolling Review platform.

Her recent work at the IT University of Copenhagen focuses on understanding large language models from a sociotechnical perspective. 
This has led her to studying the impact of data on what these models converge to, as well as how to make NLP models more efficient, transparent and reliable.
