Anna Rogers is an tenured Associate Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen is one of the foremost experts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Her expertise ranges from ethics in NLP to frame semantics, and from computational social science to interpretability.
Her contribution to the field goes beyond widely acclaimed scientific articles; she has also taken on significant responsibilities within the community, including heading the scientific committee of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023), and more recently taking on the role of co-editor-in-chief for the ACL Rolling Review platform.

Her recent work at the IT University of Copenhagen focuses on understanding large language models from a sociotechnical perspective. 
This has led her to studying the impact of data on what these models converge to, as well as how to make NLP models more efficient, transparent and reliable.
