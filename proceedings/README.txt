when running aclpub2/openreview/or2papers.py and aclpub2/openreview/or2program_committee.py:
	I've had to escape several characters of my password
	our venue id is IWCS/2025/Workshop/BriGap-2

During the execution of the scripts, you may see a message such as "ERROR: or_id not found". It means that the script could not retrieve the profile's information from OpenReview. Therefore, you must insert manually the data in the paper.yml or program_committee.yml. You can identify the problematic OpenReview ID and their papers in paper.log and program_committee.log
