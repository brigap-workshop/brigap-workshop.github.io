# About

The first edition of the workshop on Bridges and Gaps between Formal and Computational Linguistics (BriGap) was held in conjunction with ESSLI 2022.

The BriGap-2 workshop is an offshoot of the monthly online [ILFC seminar](https://gdr-lift.loria.fr/monthy-online-ilfc-seminar/), also organized by Timothée Bernard and Grégoire Winterstein.
The online seminar is open to the general public.
